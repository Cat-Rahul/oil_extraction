A.1.2 General The API Monogram® is a registered certification mark owned by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and authorized for licensing by the API Board of Directors. Through the API Monogram Program, API licenses product manufacturers to apply the API Monogram to products which comply with product specifications and have been manufactured under a quality management system that meets the requirements of API Q1. API maintains a complete, searchable list of all Monogram licensees on the API Composite List website (www.api.org/compositelist). The application of the API Monogram and license number on products constitutes a representation and warranty by the licensee to API and to purchasers of the products that, as of the date indicated, the products were manufactured under a quality management system conforming to the requirements of API Q1 and that the product conforms in every detail with the applicable standard(s) or product specification(s). API Monogram program licenses are issued only after an on-site audit has verified that an organization has implemented and continually maintained a quality management system that meets the requirements of API Q1 and that the resulting products satisfy the requirements of the applicable API product specification(s) and/or standard(s). Although any manufacturer may claim that its products meet API product requirements without monogramming them, only manufacturers with a license from API can apply the API Monogram to their products. Together with the requirements of the API Monogram license agreement, this annex establishes the requirements for those organizations who wish to voluntarily obtain an API license to provide API monogrammed products that satisfy the requirements of the applicable API product specification(s) and/or standard(s) and API Monogram Program requirements.

See Figure F.1 and Figure F.2 for examples of thermocouple locations. a) Top view b) Side view SPECIFICATION FOR PIPELINE AND PIPING VALVES 3 1,4 2 1,7 4,5,6 5 3,9 2,8 9 6,7 8 a) Side view b) Top view Figure F.2—Thermocouple Locations—Cylindrical Furnace (Working Zone) For furnaces having a working zone less than 10 ft3 (0.3 m3), the temperature survey may be made with a minimum of three thermocouples located either at the front, center, and rear or at the top, center, and bottom of the furnace working zone. After insertion of the temperature-sensing devices, readings shall be taken at least once every 3 min to determine when the temperature of the furnace working zone approaches the bottom of the temperature range being surveyed. Once the furnace temperature has reached the set-point temperature, the temperature of all test locations shall be recorded at 2-min intervals, maximum, for at least 10 min. Then readings shall be taken at 5-min intervals, maximum, for sufficient time (at least 30 min) to determine the recurrent temperature pattern of the furnace working zone. Before the furnace set-point temperature is reached, none of the temperature readings shall exceed the set-point temperature by more than ±25 °F (±13 °C). After the furnace control set-point temperature is reached, no temperature reading shall vary beyond the limits specified. The temperatures within each furnace shall be surveyed within one year prior to use of the furnace for heat treatment. F.3.3 Temperature Survey Method for Recalibration of Batch-type Furnaces When a furnace is repaired or rebuilt, a new temperature survey shall be carried out before the furnace is used for heat treatment, subject to the following. 81 82 API SPECIFICATION 6D The SAE AMS 2750 sections on furnace modifications and furnace repairs shall be used to determine whether a new furnace survey is required.

Table J.4—Documentation Requirements Annex K (informative) Isolation Valve Features K.1 General Table K.1 is intended to give informative guidance on typical valve functions/features and is not intended to either be all-inclusive or restrictive. Individual valve designs exist that have unique sealing characteristics for which the table may not be appropriate or applicable. The user should take guidance from the manufacturer on establishing particular valve features. The user is responsible for ensuring the operational requirements are consistent with particular valve features including sealing capability and function. The table and sketches are intended to give definition of the terms “block and bleed” (Figure K.1 and Figure K.2), “double block and bleed” (Figure K.3 and Figure K.4), and “double isolation and bleed” (Figure K.5 and Figure K.6) in a single valve or double valve arrangement as defined by this specification. Other documents, including applicable federal regulations, may have a different definition of these terms. K.2 Block and Bleed (BB) BB may be achieved by a connection in the pipework/pipeline downstream of the block valve or from a connection on the valve body when the valve is an upstream seating type. Pressure source Block Open end/ equipment Bleed Figure K.1—Block and Bleed—Type A Pressure source Block Open end/ equipment Bleed 100 API SPECIFICATION 6D K.3 Double Block and Bleed (DBB) The DBB feature of the valve or valves is the ability to segregate two pressure sources and to bleed/vent pressure in the void between the two sealing elements (blocks). The bleed may be in the pipework/pipeline when two valves are used, or in the valve body between the two seats when the valve has the DBB feature. Pressure source Block Block Pressure source Bleed Figure K.3—Double Block and Bleed—Type A Pressure source Block Pressure source Block Bleed Figure K.4—Double Block and Bleed—Type B K.4 Double Isolation and Bleed (DIB) The DIB feature of the valve or valves is the ability to provide two sealing elements to a single pressure source, and to bleed/vent between the two sealing elements. Note that some documents dealing with isolation of equipment may refer to this feature as double block and bleed. Pressure source Block Block Open end/ equipment Bleed Figure K.5—Double Isolation and Bleed—Type A Pressure source Block Block Open end/ equipment SPECIFICATION FOR PIPELINE AND PIPING VALVES Table K.1—Isolation Valve Types NOTE 1 The term upstream and downstream refer to the pressure source and open end/equipment respectively and do not refer to flow direction. NOTE 2 Not possible to bleed from valve body, but bleed may be in downstream pipework/pipeline. NOTE 3 Depending on detail design of the valve, some valves may have preferred sealing direction and/or a specified sequence of operation. NOTE 4 Depending on detailed design. NOTE 5 Downstream seat may provide a second barrier at pressures below the cavity relieving pressure, but will not provide a high pressure barrier. NOTE 6 Depending on detailed design and ability to achieve testing per H.12. 101 Annex L (normative) External Coating for End Connections L.1 General This annex provides coating guidelines of both flange and weld end connections and shall be performed after all testing is completed.

O.2 Field Testing Pressures during the testing of installed valves should not exceed the pressure rating of the valve by more than 50 % when testing with the valve partially open or by more than 10 % when testing against a closed valve. Tests specified with the valve half-open may also be performed with the valve fully open, provided the body cavity is simultaneously filled and pressurized through a cavity connection. NOTE The maximum test pressure for valves fitted with an external pressure relief can be lower (see 5.8). O.3 Pressure Relief Certain valve designs trap pressure in the valve body cavity when the valve is in the fully open and/or closed position. High internal pressures can result from the thermal expansion of the fluid trapped in these confined areas. If the valve has no self-relieving design provision, pressure-relief fittings shall be fitted in the valve body in accordance with 5.8. O.4 Pigging The purchaser should examine the valve design for piggability when ordering valves for use in pipelines requiring pigging. NOTE 1 Venturi or reduced-bore valves are not suitable for most pigging operations, including intelligent pigging, but can allow the passage of foam pigs. NOTE 2 A valve in which the drive member or the obturator obstructs the bore in the otherwise fully open position (e.g. a dual- plate check valve) is not piggable. NOTE 3 Certain full-opening valves with pockets can allow bypass of fluid around a short pig or sphere. O.5 Fire Type-testing The fire-tested design of valves shall be qualified by fire type-testing in accordance with one of the following: API 6FA, API 6FD, API 607, or ISO 10497. NOTE For the purposes of this specification, the terms “fire type-test” and “fire test” are synonymous.
